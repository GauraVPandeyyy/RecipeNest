# 🍽️ RecipeNest – Progressive Web App for Managing Recipes

RecipeNest is a modern, responsive, and installable **Progressive Web App (PWA)** built with React and Vite. It allows users to **create, view, edit, delete, and favorite** recipes. The application runs completely on the frontend using **localStorage** for persistence — no backend required.

Users can install the app on their **mobile or desktop** devices and enjoy an app-like experience with offline capabilities.
